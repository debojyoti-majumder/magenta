This is location where people can add the notebooks to others to look at some tangable task done. Code snippet would be taken from this section and put into the main library. Once the code has been taken from this place to the library the files would be removed to keep this staging place clean. 

Guidelines:
- Prefix your name/githib handel and then the notebook name. 
- Please add data collection step and try to automate that in notebook.
- Feel free to edit someone's notebook to add some findings.
- We are not using forks, new users are added as colaborator to the code base.
- For any specific task request/question/clearfication create an issue in main repo.
- The resources are added in no perticular order, go through based on your skills but it is expected the contibutor have gone through all of them(in some time span) 
- We lack a lot about standard dataset as of now. Anybody who finds any data set related to audio please add in the data set section.

Resources: 
- https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning The most widely used ML resource, very useful to get started
- https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks One the definitive resource learn about Deep Learning. Good resource for intermediate people. I feel the explanation can be bit better but still worth looking into them.
- http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/ Best place to start DL very well explained for beginner level audience.
- http://course.fast.ai/ Very good course on deep learning. Essential to go through
- https://www.coursera.org/learn/audio-signal-processing This has nothing to do with ML but has everything to do with Audio processing. Must complete course to get strated.
- https://books.google.co.in/books?id=2pK_DQAAQBAJ This is the book which describes all the problems very correctly which we face while create a audio processing/generation library
- https://books.google.co.in/books?id=fEsZ3Ey-Hq4C Very good book to find ideas for building some cool audio IR system
